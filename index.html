<p>This year the voting regarding the team of the year was very complicated as there were many players who were deserving but there can only be 11 players who will achieve this special feat. The TOTY event is the most awaited event in the game and it has been even in the past series.</p>
<p>Since the addition of female players in the game has been added, it will be for the first time that the TOTY Women's Team will be featured.</p>
<p>Along with it, there will be a TOTY Honorable Mentions as usual, which will allow the player's who were close to being a TOTY player get a special card in the game.</p>
